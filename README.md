# Tesseract-RHEL-Cent-Os
Installation steps for Tesseract-4.0 on AWS EMR which is based on RHEL system.

Installing Tesseract on a Ubuntu system is pretty straightforward as all the libraries are available in the apt-get repository list. 
However it is not the case with RHEL/CentOs systems. AWS EMR is based on RHEL and installing Tesseract on it is a very tedious task.
The above shell script successfully installs Tesseract on AWS EMR.
